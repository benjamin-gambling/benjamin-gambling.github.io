          I’m Ben and I’m a self-taught web developer currently living in Whistler, Canada with my partner. As you can probably
          tell by my choice of home, I love the outdoors, when I’m not working you’ll find me skiing, hiking,
          camping or discovering new places. When I have to be indoors you’ll find me watching sports or playing boards games like Settlers of Catan (look
          it up and thank me later).
          </p>
          <p>         
          Originally from Sheffield in the north of England, where I lived and studied until the age of 21 before making the move
          south to London after graduating from university. A couple of years down the line I came to the realization  that i wanted to spend last time commuting and more time doing the things I love. So I
          decided to make a slightly bigger move to Australia where if you can believe it or not I found a love for skiing. Not
          wanting winter to end I decided to chase it all the way to Canada and i've never left since.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the beginning of this year I decided to follow my heart and set out to become full time Web Developer. So the past
        few months it has been like a full time job, spending 40 hours a week following a few different curriculums and building projects that
        interested me and helped me cement what I had learnt.
        </p>
        <p>
        I’m currently still learning and I doubt my hunger to learn more will stop anytime soon but I’ve reached a point that I feel I’m ready for the
        next step, to break into the industry and write code that actually helps people!
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are new to web development or interested about my journey, keep an eye out for my blog, where I plan to document my journey from the very
        start through to my search for jobs, hopefully helping people in the same position that i was in all those months ago.

              <p>
              Working in number of roles within the  product sales and services team in both Falls Creek, Australia and Whistler, Canada, I have
              overseen large teams of seasonal employees who are required to sell products and provide exceptional guest service. I
              have played a huge part in the testing and integration of a new point of sales system, which was produced in house and
              is continuously being developed. As the largest resort it is vital that both the guests and employees have a smooth user
              experience with our online and in resort sales systems.
              </p>
              <p>
              Due to a large turnover of staff year every year it is critical that we provide staff with the tools to succeed. To do
              this we provided in-depth training, constant development and online resources through our intranet as well as a constant
              front line presence to assist however it was needed. The role was always changing and required me to adapt my whole schedule on a
              moments notice, being unpredictable the weather and lift mechanics could cause chaos, this required quick thinking,
              problem solving under pressure and a level head to help savior the guests experience.

              Recruited straight out of university for my masters work involving the dynamic effects on buildings in disastrous
              circumstances. The job consisted of work winning, project/account management, researching potential clients and working
              within large teams of multi-disciplinary and multi-national personnel. The engineering side consisted of a range of
              different roles such as: -
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Blast Engineering</li>
                <li>Research & Development</li>

                <li>Structural Design</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              During my time I was also heavily involved with the Structural Engineering division due to my experience in the field. I
              worked with them on a number of large-scale structural projects. After working them I found a few areas to increase
              productivity, I noticed a lot of time was spent manually inputting numbers from a structural modeling program to design
              pad foundations. I created a sophisticated spreadsheet that would take the information straight from the sheet itself
              and calculate the results, saving 2-3 hours each time.

              <strong class="docs-header">The Odin Project Bootcamp</strong><br />
              The Odin Project is an open source project that has the same curriculum and structure as a bootcamp however it is
              designed for people that can’t meet the strict schedule that most bootcamps have and using some of the best online
              resources from a number of different sites. The curriculum focuses on full-stack JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. Its first
              module Web Development 101 helps you get set up with the basics and really see the full picture of what a web developer
              does and the tools they need. The next modules focus of the more advanced front end topics and then moves towards the
              back end along with the use of
              databases.<br />

              <strong class="docs-header">Free Code Camp</strong><br />
              Free Code Camp is an online education platform that focuses on full-stack JavaScript. It has a built in console where
              you type code straight into the browser and either pass or fail. It’s a great resource that bypasses the set up you need
              on a workstation. Its offers a number of certificates in the full-stack curriculum such as: - <br />

                <li>Responsive Web Design</li>

                <li>Data Visualization</li>
                <li>APIs and Microservices</li>

              <strong class="docs-header">Harvard CS50x</strong><br />
              On the EdX platform Harvard offer their computer science courses for free; they have a wide range of different content
              for different interests and career paths. The content they provide is exceptional for truly understanding the theory
              behind how things work. The course path that I am currently following is : - <br />
              <br />
              <ul>
                <li>Introduction to Computer Science</li>
                <li>Web Programing with Python and JavaScript</li>
                <li>Mobile App Development with React Native</li>

              <strong class="docs-header">The University of Sheffield - MEng Civil & Structural
                Engineering </strong><br />
              During my time at University i specialized in structural dynamics
              in high stress situations, mainly high-rise structures under
              blast, fire and seismic loads. My final year project involved
              modeling the results on a departmental software created with
              Fortran that calculated the deformation of steel framed structures
              under high temperature loading. I did this by using visual basics
              to create a 3D model of the structure at different time periods
              during the fire. As visual basics and Fortran are both outdated
              and new programming language's are much more efficient and user
              friendly, i wrote a report about the need to bring these programs
              up to date and using a language like C++ would be much more
              maintainable as the industry advances. This was well receive and
              funding was approved for the project the following year of my graduation. I received a final grade of
              2:1 with honors.

        <h6 class="docs-header">My Blog (A.K.A CODEVID-19)</h6>
        <p>
          Here lies the temporary home of my soon to be blog, I have never
          blogged before and as a matter of fact my grammar and punctuation is
          horrendous so I can only apologies in advance for the extra long
          sentences and incorrect there’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason however that I am sat writing the introduction to my own
          blog, which I have cleverly called CODEVID-19, is because in March
          2020 when the world was hit by a global pandemic, I decided to take a
          leap of faith and change my life for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to (attempt) teach myself web development, something I have
          wanted to do for a long time but didn’t know exactly where to start or
          what exactly to learn. I had the luxury of time, I have spent roughly
          around 40 hours a week doing this for the past 6 months. I felt this was realistic to help
          maintain a work/life balance, i didn't lock myself in a room and only come out to eat, i did normal stuff, maybe not as
          much as i would have liked but i wanted to be somewhat strict. I went a couple of road trips, spent
          time with my partner, the same stuff as I did when I was working. I
          didn’t want it to consume me but I also didn’t want to fail so the balance was a challenge and it took awhile to find
          the middle ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others may not have the luxury of time, it is not always realistic to
          just quit your job and spend 60 hours a week learning something new.
          However I hope to help provide a path, share my experiences and help
          ease someone who is in the position I was once in make that change.
          You might only be able to commit a few hours a week, after work, on
          your lunch, but hopefully you will gain momentum, avoid those dead
          ends and learn something new. Even if you don’t end up becoming a web
          developer you will have gained a valuable skill which cant be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web/Software development is a huge field with many possible routes and
          it can be scary looking at making the change especially with so many
          unknowns. It certainly was for me 5 months ago but now I’m here,
          telling you about it and indeed the future is still uncertain but it
          is honestly the best decision I have ever made and I’m hoping that
          this story will give someone that nudge they need to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey is still early on, this isn’t one of those unrealistic
          success stories, this is just me sharing my journey with you and
          lending a helping hand. When I’ve needed it the most, help has found
          me in some way shape or form, it’s a kind community of people who have
          experienced similar things and I hope that I can give back to it and
          encourage others to be part of it.
