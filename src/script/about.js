I’m Ben and I’m a self-taught web developer currently living in Whistler, Canada with my partner. As you can probably
tell by my choice of home, I love the outdoors, when I’m not working you’ll find me skiing, hiking,
camping or discovering new places. When I have to be indoors you’ll find me watching sports or playing boards games like Settlers of Catan (look
it up and thank me later).
</p>

Originally from Sheffield in the north of England, where I lived and studied until the age of 21 before making the move
south to London after graduating from university. A couple of years down the line I came to the realization  that i wanted to spend last time commuting and more time doing the things I love. So I
decided to make a slightly bigger move to Australia where if you can believe it or not I found a love for skiing. Not
wanting winter to end I decided to chase it all the way to Canada and i've never left since.

At the beginning of this year I decided to follow my heart and set out to become full time Web Developer. So the past
few months it has been like a full time job, spending 40 hours a week following a few different curriculums and building projects that
interested me and helped me cement what I had learnt.
</p>
<p>
I’m currently still learning and I doubt my hunger to learn more will stop anytime soon but I’ve reached a point that I feel I’m ready for the
next step, to break into the industry and write code that actually helps people!
</p>
<p>
If you are new to web development or interested about my journey, keep an eye out for my blog, where I plan to document my journey from the very
start through to my search for jobs, hopefully helping people in the same position that i was in all those months ago.
