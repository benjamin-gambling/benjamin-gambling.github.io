        <p>
          Here lies the temporary home of my soon to be blog, I have never
          blogged before and as a matter of fact my grammar and punctuation is
          horrendous so I can only apologies in advance for the extra long
          sentences and incorrect there’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason however that I am sat writing the introduction to my own
          blog, which I have cleverly called CODEVID-19, is because in March
          2020 when the world was hit by a global pandemic, I decided to take a
          leap of faith and change my life for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to (attempt) teach myself web development, something I have
          wanted to do for a long time but didn’t know exactly where to start or
          what exactly to learn. I had the luxury of time, I have spent roughly
          around 40 hours a week doing this for the past 6 months. I felt this
          was realistic to help maintain a work/life balance, i didn't lock
          myself in a room and only come out to eat, i did normal stuff, maybe
          not as much as i would have liked but i wanted to be somewhat strict.
          I went a couple of road trips, spent time with my partner, the same
          stuff as I did when I was working. I didn’t want it to consume me but
          I also didn’t want to fail so the balance was a challenge and it took
          awhile to find the middle ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others may not have the luxury of time, it is not always realistic to
          just quit your job and spend 60 hours a week learning something new.
          However I hope to help provide a path, share my experiences and help
          ease someone who is in the position I was once in make that change.
          You might only be able to commit a few hours a week, after work, on
          your lunch, but hopefully you will gain momentum, avoid those dead
          ends and learn something new. Even if you don’t end up becoming a web
          developer you will have gained a valuable skill which cant be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web/Software development is a huge field with many possible routes and
          it can be scary looking at making the change especially with so many
          unknowns. It certainly was for me 5 months ago but now I’m here,
          telling you about it and indeed the future is still uncertain but it
          is honestly the best decision I have ever made and I’m hoping that
          this story will give someone that nudge they need to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey is still early on, this isn’t one of those unrealistic
          success stories, this is just me sharing my journey with you and
          lending a helping hand. When I’ve needed it the most, help has found
          me in some way shape or form, it’s a kind community of people who have
          experienced similar things and I hope that I can give back to it and
          encourage others to be part of it.
