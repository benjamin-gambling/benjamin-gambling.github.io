              <p>
              Working in number of roles within the  product sales and services team in both Falls Creek, Australia and Whistler, Canada, I have
              overseen large teams of seasonal employees who are required to sell products and provide exceptional guest service. I
              have played a huge part in the testing and integration of a new point of sales system, which was produced in house and
              is continuously being developed. As the largest resort it is vital that both the guests and employees have a smooth user
              experience with our online and in resort sales systems.
              </p>
              <p>
              Due to a large turnover of staff year every year it is critical that we provide staff with the tools to succeed. To do
              this we provided in-depth training, constant development and online resources through our intranet as well as a constant
              front line presence to assist however it was needed. The role was always changing and required me to adapt my whole schedule on a
              moments notice, being unpredictable the weather and lift mechanics could cause chaos, this required quick thinking,
              problem solving under pressure and a level head to help savior the guests experience.

              <p>
              Recruited straight out of university for my masters work involving the dynamic effects on buildings in disastrous
              circumstances. The job consisted of work winning, project/account management, researching potential clients and working
              within large teams of multi-disciplinary and multi-national personnel. The engineering side consisted of a range of
              different roles such as: -
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Blast Engineering</li>
                <li>Research & Development</li>
                <li>Counter-Terrorism Measures</li>
                <li>Explosive Safety</li>
                <li>Hostile Vehicle Mitigation</li>
                <li>Personal & Private Security</li>
                <li>Structural Design</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              During my time I was also heavily involved with the Structural Engineering division due to my experience in the field. I
              worked with them on a number of large-scale structural projects. After working them I found a few areas to increase
              productivity, I noticed a lot of time was spent manually inputting numbers from a structural modeling program to design
              pad foundations. I created a sophisticated spreadsheet that would take the information straight from the sheet itself
              and calculate the results, saving 2-3 hours each time.

              The Odin Project is an open source project that has the same curriculum and structure as a bootcamp however it is
              designed for people that can’t meet the strict schedule that most bootcamps have and using some of the best online
              resources from a number of different sites. The curriculum focuses on full-stack JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. Its first
              module Web Development 101 helps you get set up with the basics and really see the full picture of what a web developer
              does and the tools they need. The next modules focus of the more advanced front end topics and then moves towards the
              back end along with the use of
              databases.<br />

              <strong class="docs-header">Free Code Camp</strong><br />
              Free Code Camp is an online education platform that focuses on full-stack JavaScript. It has a built in console where
              you type code straight into the browser and either pass or fail. It’s a great resource that bypasses the set up you need
              on a workstation. Its offers a number of certificates in the full-stack curriculum such as: - <br />

              <strong class="docs-header">The University of Sheffield - MEng Civil & Structural
                Engineering </strong><br />
              During my time at University i specialized in structural dynamics
              in high stress situations, mainly high-rise structures under
              blast, fire and seismic loads. My final year project involved
              modeling the results on a departmental software created with
              Fortran that calculated the deformation of steel framed structures
              under high temperature loading. I did this by using visual basics
              to create a 3D model of the structure at different time periods
              during the fire. As visual basics and Fortran are both outdated
              and new programming language's are much more efficient and user
              friendly, i wrote a report about the need to bring these programs
              up to date and using a language like C++ would be much more
              maintainable as the industry advances. This was well receive and
              funding was approved for the project the following year of my graduation. I received a final grade of
              2:1 with honors.
